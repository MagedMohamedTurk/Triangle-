This is a simple program to check triangle sides and classify it by angle and sides.  
The purpose of this program in C for me is to find the best practice in C.  
Using makefile and create tests to debug functions.  
to run the program from main directory:  
$ ./check_triangle  
to rebuild the binary file:  
$ make  
to run tests from /test directory:  
$ ./test_triangle\b
to rebuild the binary file:\b
$ make
